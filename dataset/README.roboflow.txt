The dataset includes 5482 images.
Currency are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 480x480 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -26 and +26 degrees
* Random shear of between -31° to +31° horizontally and -18° to +18° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -26 and +26 percent

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels
